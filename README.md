An unofficial App to use Jellyfin on your Ubports-Device.

Jellyfin on Github: https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin

Basically Jellyfin is a web-based application. JellyfUn is a simple App to get comfortable access to your Jellyfin-Server.

It is tested on a Nexus5, so no warranty that it will run on other devices.

No background-playback at the moment.

Maybe it's necessary to scale the web-view on your device. Use the Settings.
