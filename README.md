To run the App in the Background:

- go to OpenStore and get "UT Tweak Tool"

- open the app after installing it

- left corner, choose in the menu "Apps + Scopes"

   Now you can listen to audio while using other apps or turn screen off

Basically Jellyfin is a web-based application. JellyfUn is a simple App to get comfortable access to your Jellyfin-Server.

It is tested on a Nexus5, so no warranty that it will run on other devices.


Maybe it's necessary to scale the web-view on your device. Use the Settings.
